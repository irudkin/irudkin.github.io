Welcome to the third article in this series. In the first, I introduced this series of articles for Safety Practitioners assessing the SYCL™ Open Standard programming model. In the previous article, I talked about how SYCL can support many of the demands outlined in chapter 6 of the ISO 26262:2018 functional safety standard. In this article, I will show you how the SYCL stack topology can support functional safety. What do I mean by topology? Topology here means a large-scale structure with many clear distinct layers separated by API boundaries. In each layer there are further structures where data flows between components as well as up and down through the layers in the stack. The shape of the structure is mainly vertical with the application at the top. This article will show how this structure is well defined yet versatile to meet the needs of the automotive application and the demands of the safety practitioner.<br/>
